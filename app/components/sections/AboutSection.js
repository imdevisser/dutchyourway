                  Hallo! I&apos;m Irmarie ðŸ‘‹
                </h3>

                <div className="space-y-5 leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                  <p>
                    Born in Pretoria (South Africa) and raised in Amersfoort
                    (The Netherlands). I&apos;ve been passionate about languages
                    and different cultures my entire life. I speak English,
                    Dutch and Afrikaans fluently. I am currently learning
                    Spanish and Zulu.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    For almost 5 years, I&apos;ve had the privilege of teaching
                    Dutch to students from around the world. What started as
                    part-time online tutoring has grown into a thriving practice
                    where I&apos;ve helped many learners achieve their Dutch
                    language goals.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    My specialty? Working with Afrikaans speakers who want to
                    master Dutch. When growing up in The Netherlands, my parents
                    continued speaking Afrikaans at home. This means that I
                    never lost touch with the language. Now I understand the
                    unique challenges and incredible advantages that Afrikaans
                    speakers have when learning Dutch. This experience has
                    shaped my teaching approach to be both efficient and
                    culturally sensitive.
